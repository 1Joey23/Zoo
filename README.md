This zoo is a c# project I am currently making in Object Oriented 2. The file was too big to upload to GitHub, so I attached a zip file instead.
This zoo allows users to add and remove guests, select the type of the animal to add, edit attributes to the guests and animals,
and there is a display window which shows an animal cage with the dedicated animal or guest in the zoo. This project
embraces the four basic principles polymorphism, abstraction, inheritance, and encapsulation.
